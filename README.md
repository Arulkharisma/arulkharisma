## Hi, I'm Arul Kharisma 👋
I am a 5th semester student in the Informatics Study Program who has an interest in technology. I want to know more about this field, and I hope to be able to contribute to the development of useful technology. Able to communicate and work together in a team and easily adapt to new things. During my studies, I worked on several projects, such as desktop applications and websites.
